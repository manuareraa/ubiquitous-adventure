            "question": "A, B, C are Truth, Lie, Random in unknown order. 'Da'/'Ja' mean yes/no, mapping unknown. You ask A: “If asked whether B is Random, would you answer as C would if asked whether you are Lie?” A replies: 'da'. What follows?",
            "choices": [
                "A) A avoids inconsistency about B.",
                "B) A isn’t Random; no other inference is firm.",
                "C) C cannot be Lie, absent Random disruption.",
                "D) No definite roles deducible from this."
            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The response involves nested hypotheticals, ambiguous language mapping, and potential randomness. Since 'da' could mean yes or no, and one speaker is Random, the information is insufficient for any definitive assignment of roles. The correct conclusion is that nothing can be concluded."

            "question": "X, Y, Z: one Knight, one Knave, one Normal. X: “If Y’s a Knave, then Z’s a Knight.” Y: “X is Knave or Normal.” Z: “If I’m Knave, so is Y.” Who is the Knight?",
            "choices": [
                "A) Truthful speaker collapses nested logic.",
                "B) Truth preserves one conditional, denies others.",
                "C) Lie resolves cyclic roles if two align.",
                "D) Role fits only if speaker’s claim holds."
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Testing each as Knight, only Z's assignment avoids contradiction. Z’s statement becomes vacuously true. Assigning Y as Knave and X as Normal satisfies all logic. Other arrangements fail, making Z the sole viable Knight."

            "question": "Left sign: “Right sign is false.” Right: “Left sign is false.” One written by a Truth-Teller, one by a Liar. What can be inferred?",
            "choices": [
                "A) Reciprocal negation forms contradiction.",
                "B) Assumed truth induces unstable loop.",

                "D) Paradox: neither statement stabilizes."
            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Each sign declares the other false, creating a circular contradiction. Assigning truth to either produces a loop where each negates the other, a classic liar paradox. No consistent, stable truth assignment is possible. The situation is paradoxical."

        {
            "question": "Two sentinels—one veracious, one mendacious—guard bifurcated paths: one fatal, one safe. One yes–no query is allowed. You ask A: “If B were asked whether left leads to safety, would he say yes?” A replies: Yes. What is logically prescribed?",
            "choices": [
                "A) Trust left, presuming A relays B’s affirmation.",
                "B) Reject left; layered deceit inverts truth.",

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This question construction neutralizes identity uncertainty. If A is truthful, he reports B’s lie; if A lies, he distorts B’s truth. In both cases, the response points to the false path. Thus, the correct action is to choose the opposite of what was affirmed."

                "A) Gamma isn’t Truth if 'zok' implies mirroring.",
                "B) Randomness and language bar firm conclusion.",
                "C) Beta is not Lie nor Random, if logic holds.",
                "D) Ambiguous code prevents direct deduction."
            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The nested, self-referential query involves ambiguous binary terms and potential randomness from any entity. Since the answer could come from a Random speaker and the yes/no mapping is unknown, no conclusive role assignment can be made. Thus, no definitive conclusion follows."

            "choices": [
                "A) Falsifying X aligns others logically.",
                "B) Y’s conditional collapses self-inconsistently.",

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Assuming X is lying allows Y and Z to be assigned roles that satisfy all statements: Z can’t be Knight as claimed by X, Y’s conditional holds if Y is Normal, and Z’s self-claim is false if Z is Normal. This forms a logically coherent mapping, confirming X is the Knave and Y the Knight."

                "B) Right’s logic collapses if honest.",
                "C) One fails under truth, other unresolved.",
                "D) No stable resolution from symmetry."
            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "If Right is true and both are false, then Right itself is false, a contradiction. If Left is true, then Right is false, which supports Left. But that would mean Left is true and Right is false. Yet that conflicts with Right's claim. The setup yields a logical paradox with no consistent grounding."

            "question": "Two guards (truth/lie) guard paths (treasure or peril). Ask one question. You ask B: “If I asked A whether right leads to treasure, would he say yes?” B says: Yes. What now?",

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The structure of the question ensures a lie either way: if B lies, he flips A’s true answer; if B tells the truth, he reports A’s lie. Both outcomes misrepresent the true path. Thus, you must reverse the indicated direction to reach the treasure. The correct choice is to go opposite to the answer given."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Brazilian (juice) has milk adjacent. Italian opposite tea. Japanese -> 2 seats left of coffee -> American must be coffee (Chinese adjacent to American, not conflicting with other constraints)."

            "answer": "B",
