  "Truth-teller and Liar Problems": [
    {
      "question": "Alpha, Beta, Gamma = Truth, Lie, Random. 'zok'/'mip' = yes/no, mapping unknown.\nYou ask Beta: “Would Gamma, if asked if Alpha is Lie, answer like you?” Beta says 'zok'. What follows?",
      "choices": [
        "A) Gamma isn’t Truth if replies match.",
        "B) No conclusion—Random or code blocks logic.",
        "C) If valid, Beta isn't Lie or Random.",
        "D) Meaning unclear—deduction fails."
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The nested query involves ambiguous yes/no terms and a Random speaker. Without knowing the mapping of 'zok' and who is Random, we cannot derive any definitive roles. So, no firm conclusion is possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "X, Y, Z are Knight, Knave, Normal.\nX: “Y is a Knave; Z is not Knight.”\nY: “If Z is a Knave, X is Knight.”\nZ: “I’m not Normal.”\nWho is the Knight?",
      "choices": [
        "A) Falsifying X aligns others logically.",
        "B) Y’s conditional collapses self-inconsistently.",
        "C) Z’s denial locks all roles by inversion.",
        "D) X’s compound truth sustains all claims."
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Assuming X is lying allows consistent assignments: Y can be Knight, Z Normal, satisfying all statements. Other configurations produce contradictions. Thus, X is Knave, Y is Knight, Z is Normal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Two papers: Left—“Right is false.” Right—“Both are false.” One writer tells truth, one lies. What must be true?",
      "choices": [
        "A) Mutual negation loops to paradox.",
        "B) Right’s logic collapses if honest.",
        "C) One fails under truth, other unresolved.",
        "D) No stable resolution from symmetry."
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "If Right is truthful, it says it's false—contradiction. If Left is truthful, then Right is false, which matches Left's claim. But then Right says both are false, making Left false too. It's a paradox either way."
    },
    {
      "question": "Two guards (truth/lie) guard paths (treasure or peril). Ask one question. You ask B: “If I asked A whether right leads to treasure, would he say yes?” B says: Yes. What now?",
      "choices": [
        "A) Trust B if truthful; go right.",
        "B) Invert layered logic; go left.",
        "C) Reverse answer; path is opposite.",
        "D) No resolution from one answer."
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a classic double-layered logic trap. If B is truthful, he reports A’s lie—resulting in a false answer. If B is lying, he distorts A’s truthful answer—again producing a false response. In both cases, the answer you receive is false. Therefore, to find the correct path, you must take the opposite of what B’s answer indicates."

  "Seating Arrangements (Linear, Circular)": [
    {
      "question": "Eight around a circle: P two seats anticlockwise of S; V third right of T; Q between P & V nonadjacent; R opposite X with one same-gender neighbour; U beside only men. Who sits immediately left of R?",
      "choices": ["A) B", "B) C", "C) D", "D) H"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "From (i) & (ii) fix the B-D-G arc; rule-chain (iii)–(v) collapses the remaining permutations to one unique circle where C winds up three seats anti-clockwise from G, i.e., third to G’s left."
    },
    {
      "question": "Seven in a north‐facing line: L–R span three seats with Q between; N immediately left of O; L left of N; S has two to his right (not extreme); P not beside Q; M immediately right of P; Q not beside O. Who occupies the rightmost seat?",
      "choices": ["A) L", "B) Q", "C) R", "D) M"],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Systematic placement (start with R–L gap, slot S at the only 5th position, anchor N-O block, apply non-adjacency rules) yields the final order L-Q-N-O-R-S-P-M. Hence M sits at the extreme right."
    },
    {
      "question": "Nine roundtable: P two seats ccw of S; V third right of T; Q between P & V nonadjacent; R opposite X & same-gender neighbour; U only beside men. Who sits left of R?",
      "choices": ["A) Q", "B) S", "C) U", "D) V"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Building clockwise from the rigid P--S spacing, then grafting the V-T sub-structure and the gender/adjacency constraints forces a single seating. In that layout U falls directly to R’s left."

    {
      "question": "Wei & Niu's children Lin & Pia (F, 27 = Ken + 3); Lin isn't Ken's father unless they're siblings; Raj (M, Ken − 6) is Lin's second child — determine Raj's linkage to Wei.",
      "choices": ["A) Son", "B) Grandson", "C) Nephew", "D) Grand-nephew"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lin is Wei's child; Raj is Lin's son (second child). Therefore Raj is Wei's grandson."

      "question": "Bo & twin Jia; Jia's firstborn Yan (M despite name; 12 yr senior to Bo's son Dev); if Yan isn't male, Jia isn't Dev's aunt; Tao = 2 × Dev; Mei = Tao − 8 — ascertain Tao's nexus to Bo.",
      "choices": ["A) Nephew", "B) Grandson", "C) Great-nephew (grand-nephew)", "D) First cousin once removed"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Yan is Jia's son, making Yan Bo's nephew; Tao is Yan's son, so Tao is Bo's great-nephew (grand-nephew)."

      "question": "Anu & Ram's offspring Iya (= Tej + 4) & Tej; Tej's spouse Uma (F, age = Iya − 6); unless Iya isn't Ram's daughter, Uma isn't daughter-in-law; Bin = ½ Uma; Lan = Iya — specify Lan's kinship to Lei (Tej's middle name).",
      "choices": ["A) Daughter", "B) Niece-in-law", "C) Grand-niece", "D) First cousin once removed"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Uma is Tej's wife, so Bin (her brother) is Tej's brother-in-law; Lan is Bin's daughter, thus Tej's niece-in-law."
